```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here) 
```

Here I will read in the data

```{r}
ucsb_grad <- read_csv(here("data", "ucsb_grad_data.csv"))
```

Here I will create a ggplot displaying year versus domestic UCSB college enrollment (ggplot(data = ucsb_grad)) with ethnicity filling col by color (geom_col(aes(fill = ethnicity)))

```{r}
#Create a bar graph of domestic enrollment vs year dependent on race/ethnicity
ggplot(data = ucsb_grad, aes(x = year_abbr, y = domestic_enrollment)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = ethnicity), position = "fill") + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Percentage of Domestic Graduate Enrollment", title = "Percentage of Domestic UCSB Graduate Enrollment by Ethnicity From 2008 to 2019") + #Added x and y-axis labels and a title
  theme_minimal() #Changed theme to minimal (theme_minimal)
```
